# Linear Regression


<br>

**Linear regression is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that computes the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent features. <br>When the number of the independent feature, is 1 then it is known as Univariate Linear regression, and in the case of more than one feature, it is known as multivariate linear regression.<br> The goal of the algorithm is to find the best linear equation that can predict the value of the dependent variable based on the independent variables. <br>The equation provides a straight line that represents the relationship between the dependent and independent variables.<br> The slope of the line indicates how much the dependent variable changes for a unit change in the independent variable(s).**

<br>

***Linear regression is used in many different fields, including finance, economics, and psychology, to understand and predict the behavior of a particular variable.*** <br>**For example, in finance, linear regression might be used to understand the relationship between a companyâ€™s stock price and its earnings or to predict the future value of a currency based on its past performance.**
